[Verse 1]
Water to the sea
How my spirit grows
The more it knows
That yours is close to me

[Verse 2]
And jealous is the sun
For every thought and beam
A warmer beam
Than he'll ever become

[Chorus]
And there's no treasure refined
That could measure my time
No fortune could be enough
'Cause my minutes and years
Will be spent right here
With you
My one true love

[Verse 3]
And I've seen it from my bed
As a wishful moon
In silent swoon
Would reflect you instead
[Verse 4]
Though years I've waited through
What is twenty four
Years or more
If the rest is spent with you?

[Chorus]
And there's no treasure refined
That could measure my time
No fortune could be enough
'Cause my minutes and years
Will be spent right here
With you
My one true love

There's no treasure refined
That could measure my time
No fortune could be enough
'Cause my minutes and years
Will be spent right here
Oh my minutes and years
Will be spent right here
Oh my minutes and years
Will be spent right here
With you
My one true love
